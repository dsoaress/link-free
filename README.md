# Linkfree

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/marscollective/link-free&stack=cms)

Linkfree is an open-source alternative to paid, limited tools like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/).

![Linkfree interface](https://marscollective.co/assets/link-free.png)

It is developed by [Mars](https://marscollective.co/) using the Jamstack architecture, combining the power of Gatsby (React and GraphQL) with styled-components and Netlify CMS to provide a fast, reliable, and fully customizable tool, _served_ by the Netlify CDN. ðŸš€

You can see it in action by visiting [our Linkfree page](https://links.marscollective.co/) ðŸŒŽ, and while you're at it, go have a look at our social networks. ðŸ˜‰

## Why use it?

Social networks like Instagram and TikTok do not provide support for clickable links on post captions. To circumvent this limitation, tools like Linktree appeared, providing users the ability to use their profile URL field to direct viewers to multiple destinations.

While these tools are simple by design, we consider them to be more expensive and less customizable than they should. Using Linktree as an example, the free version doesn't even provide a proper color customization option, and even the paid version doesn't allow you to serve your page using a custom domain.

## Available features

Other than creating a link list, currently, you can:

- Add a custom logo;
- Add a custom favicon;
- Integrate Google Tag Manager with just an ID;
- Freely customize buttons, background, and font colors;
- Customize the button's border-radius (make it square or rounder).

You can also live preview all your changes while you work on them.

## Deploying your Linkfree

Just click the "Netlify" button at the top of this README. Yup, that's it. ðŸ˜„

You just have to follow the instructions and you'll have a copy of our repository, with even our links so you can get used to the admin panel.

## License and contributions

This project is open source and you're free to fork and remix it to fit your needs.

If there's any feature you'd like to see implemented, we'd love to see your feedback on our [issues page](https://github.com/marscollective/gatsby-themes/issues). While we can't promise to develop every request, we're happy to accept community contributions.
